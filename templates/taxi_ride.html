    <h2>  BACKGROUND </h2>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">
        This project builds a complete end-to-end MLOps workflow using real-world Chicago Taxi Trips data. It covers everything from data 
        ingestion and exploratory data analysis to experiment tracking, model deployment, and monitoring using modern tools like MLflow, Mage, 
        AWS S3, Docker, and Evidently.
    </p>
    <h2> I. INTRODUCTION </h2>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">
        The Chicago Taxi Trips dataset is a rich source of information about taxi rides in Chicago, including pickup and drop-off locations, 
        timestamps, trip distances, and fare amounts. This project aims to build a machine learning model to predict taxi fares based on these 
        features, providing valuable insights for both taxi operators and passengers.
    </p>
    <h2> II. DATASET </h2>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">
        The dataset consists of over 1.5 million records of taxi trips in Chicago, collected from the City of Chicago's open data portal. 
        Each record includes features such as pickup and drop-off locations, timestamps, trip distances, and fare amounts. In order to ingest the data
        , I have used the python script to ingest the data via request library and store it in the local directory. 
    </p>
    <h2> III. MLOPS PIPELINE </h2>
    <h3> 1. Data Ingestion & Exploration </h3>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">
        The first stage of this project focused on acquiring and understanding the Chicago Taxi Trips dataset, a large and diverse collection 
        of trip records from the cityâ€™s open data portal. To ensure reliability and reproducibility, I implemented an automated process to 
        fetch and store monthly data in an efficient Parquet format, providing a consistent foundation for downstream analysis.
    <p style="text-align: justify;">
        Once the data was ingested, I carried out an exploratory analysis to assess quality, engineer meaningful features, and uncover patterns 
        that could influence trip duration. This involved creating variables such as trip distance, time of day, day of week, and weekend 
        indicators, alongside parsing timestamps for temporal insights.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">
        A preliminary RandomForest model was used to gauge feature importance, revealing key drivers like distance and location attributes. 
        Visual analysis highlighted trends in trip durations across weekdays, differences between trips with complete and missing location 
        data, and the relative influence of various predictors. By the end of this phase, the dataset was clean, enriched, and well-understood, 
        providing a strong analytical foundation for model development in the subsequent stages of the MLOps pipeline.
